## **uv** for fast and versatile package management in Python

This post is probably only interesting to you if you program in Python.

If you're not using `conda`, you've probably resorted to `pip` to manage your packages.   
If you've worked in multiple projects at the same time, it's quite likely you've used `virtualenv` at some point, or other virtual environment alternatives like `pipenv`.

### Pros and cons

- Pros: 

As of 2024, a new, Rust-written, Python package and project manager has been developed. It aims to substitute the functionality of many other Python package managers. Its name is `uv`, developed by [Astral](https://astral.sh/).

`uv` allows you to create and manage a virtual environment, install or remove packages or different Python versions and much more within a single tool. 

And most importantly, it does it crazy fast, here are their own benchmarks for installing Trio's dependencies with a warm cache. ![Installing Trio's dependencies with a warm cache](image.png){fig-align="center"}

Hence, its two main strengths are **versatility** and **speed**.   
I'd like to emphasize how versatile uv is by citing their own words: 

>ðŸš€ A single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.

*Edit March 2025*: After some use of the tool, I've also found an additional advantage. 
It's quite neat for managing orphaned dependencies. Imagine you install a python package like 
openai but later in the project you realize you don't need it. You uninstall it, but its
dependencies are left hanging, some might be relevant dependencies for other 
packages in your project, whereas others don't really matter anymore. 

How do you distinguish which packages to erase? With pip only the openai package
gets uninstalled, but the others are left to you to uninstall manually.
However, uv does this automatically every time it locks the project (e.g.
`uv init`, `uv run`, we'll see the commands later).
Hence, if you run `uv remove openai` and then execute Python, the hanging dependencies
will be resolved. 

- Cons: 

Right now, the only main con that I can think of is that the tool is owned by Astral, 
and even though it's open source and free to use now, maybe in the future its 
commercial terms might change. 

### Integrating uv into existing workflows 

The best in-depth article I've read about it is [this one](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/uv-deep-dive/). Particularly, the sections that I find the most useful for reference are the cheatsheets; one for [uv vs existing tooling](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/uv-deep-dive/#cheatsheet-uv-versus-existing-tooling), and then the [native uv workflow](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/uv-deep-dive/#cheatsheet-common-operations-in-uvs-workflows).

To build upon it, here I'll outline some commands to create a quick reference cheatsheet based on my experience with the package.

Here are the commands I promised. First for integrating UV into your current use of pip or virtualenv. Then, on how to use native uv when setting up a completely new project.

1)  `uv` installation:

-   macOS/Linux: 
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
-   Windows: 
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
-   pip: 
```bash
pip install uv
```

2)  Installing Python:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
```

3)  Managing virtual environments:

- Previously: 
```bash
python3.12 -m venv /path/to/environment
```
- Currently: 
```bash
uv venv /path/to/environment --python 3.12
```

4)  Installing a package:

- Previously: 
```bash
pip install flask
``` 
- Currently: 
```bash
uv pip install flask
```

5)  Building package dependencies (requirements.txt) file:

- pip-tools: 
```bash 
pip-compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
```  
- uv: 
```bash
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
```

*) BONUS: Exporting package dependencies from native uv to requirements.txt:

Sometimes you might find yourself needing requirements.txt of a project you've
built with uv (at least I've found myself in that situation) but you're not familiar
with the use of of requirements.in files. You can use several commands to export all your dependencies from your lockfile (`uv.lock`): 


This is the native and preferred way as it relocks the project before exporting, 
this means that new packages added to the pyproject.toml file get synced into
the uv.lock file and the virtual environment where Python lives, so it's slightly
more trustworthy than uv pip freeze.

```bash
uv export --no-hashes --format requirements-txt > requirements.txt
```

Note that --no-hashes is just used to avoid showing the exact hashes of the
package download, remove it if needed. 

OR

```bash
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using native uv:

1) Initializing repo: `uv init repo`

    That will create a `pyproject.toml` file, which will handle the package requirements of the project. 
    It also automatically creates a virtual environment.

2) Adding package dependencies: `uv add` (e.g., flask)  

    You can also manually specify packages in `pyproject.toml`. There are
    many options to specify the source, or specify a different package 
    version depending on the OS you're using. For more info check
    the [uv add docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add).

3) Removing package dependencies: `uv remove`  

    Same as the previous one but for removing dependencies from the toml file.
    Here uv shines for its quick conflict resolution.

4) Installing dependencies: `uv sync`

This part involves a two-step process. First, it locks the project dependencies from
pyproject.toml into a lockfile (`uv.lock`), which has a complete detail about
all the direct and indirect dependencies of the project. After that, it 
installs (or removes) the changes in dependencies into the virtual environment, 
setting everything up to run your project with the exact set of dependencies you've specified.


5) Running a python file: `uv run` (e.g., app.py)

This one is similar to running `python script.py`, but first it run `uv sync` to make sure that all dependencies are installed and up to date before running.  
If you want to run Python interactively, you can specify `uv run python`

6) Checking current dependencies tree: `uv tree`

This is a very short list of commands I've found useful so far, for more information please check out the blog I've mentioned above and feel free to reach me out
if you'd like me to add something.

In next posts I might expand on the use of `uv` or explore `Ruff`, a very fast linter from the same developers.

Thanks for reading and I hope you found this useful!
