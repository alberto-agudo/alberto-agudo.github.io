Hi, this is Alberto. Welcome to my blog. I will use it as a platform to collate my notes and thoughts about different programming, statistics, and AI concepts. I intend to use it as a way to record what I learn, so that new ideas become clearer by trying to explain them and also so you can benefit from it.

As most of my posts will be related to code or other technical concepts, I'd like to sometimes complement the content of the blog with images of a completely unrelated topic that I find enjoyable: Sculpture. This is the [Artemision Jockey](https://www.namuseum.gr/en/collection/ellinistiki-periodos-2/), a bronze sculpture from the Hellenistic Period which can be found in the Archaeological Museum of Athens. It shows a young jockey riding a horse.

I did not take this photo, but I have been lucky enough to see this work in person (and bad enough of a photographer to not use the one I took at the museum). I am humbled to think that someone was able to craft this with bronze more than two thousand years ago. I find it inspiring, and it motivates me to learn and become a craftsman like the author of this piece of art. Hence, I hope this blog helps me as well as you to, just like that horse, push forward.
